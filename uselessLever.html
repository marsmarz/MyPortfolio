            This is a box that has a lever built out of LEGO on the outside. 
            When the lever is pulled from one side to the other, the distance 
            sensor is able to detect it. When the distance sensor detects the change, 
            a servo motor flips the lever back into place. The robot also tracks how many 
            times the lever has been flipped and how long it was being flipped for, and broadcasts 
            those numbers through the speaker at the press of a button. This project was made 
            for the Tufts Engineering Design Lab.<br>

                From this angle, you can see the button that is used to have the speaker say the time and number of flicks.
                Besides that, the button also stops the code from running.</div>
                <div class="col-4"><img src="Mario Sanchez box front view.jpg" class="box"><br>
                From the front, the lever can be seen. You can also see the hole through which the distance sensor can see and the motor can push a LEGO piece through to wack the lever back into place.

                <div class="col-4"><img src="Mario Sanchez box top view.jpg" class="box"><br>
                From the top, you can see the LEGO pieces on the bottom of the box used to keep the robot facing the right direction, as well as a bird's eye view of the sensors and servo motor.</div>
