            This project was an attempt at recreating a Jeopardy-style game through HTML and Javascript. 
            This project was made in a group along with Alisha Farmer, Amna Jan, Ben Chapman, and Nick Babey. 
            The rules don't line up 1 to 1 with Jeopardy, as Jeopardy was mostly taken as an inspiration for the 
            general structure of the game, rather than it being used as an exact model. The way the game works is that 
            there are two players, and each one takes a turn answering a question. If one person gets the question wrong, 
            the other player gets the opportunity to guess. This keeps repeating until one of the two gets the answer correct, 
            upon which the points are awarded to whoever got it correct, and it is displayed at the bottom. Once all of 
            the questions are answered, the game will end and will announce which player got the most points. I worked primarily
            on the Javascript along with Nick, while the rest worked primarily on the HTML.
